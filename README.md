# Plan
* Load an 'A' glyph into a numpy array.
* Manipulate the glyph in rotations.
* Impose the glyph on a background of noise.
* Be able to view the resulting images.
* Write a U-net to pick out the A (bounding box or the 'A' itself?)

# Resources
* Might be useful for reading in the fonts: https://dbader.org/blog/monochrome-font-rendering-with-freetype-and-python
